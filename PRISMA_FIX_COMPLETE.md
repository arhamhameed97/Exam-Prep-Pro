# 🎉 Prisma Query Engine Issue FIXED!

## ✅ Problem Solved

The **Prisma Query Engine not found** error has been resolved! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 Changes Made:

1. **Updated `next.config.mjs`:**
   - Enhanced Webpack configuration for better Prisma bundling
   - Added proper alias resolution for `@prisma/client`

2. **Updated `vercel.json`:**
   - Fixed function patterns to only include actual serverless functions
   - Added `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY: "false"` to build environment
   - Ensured Prisma client files are included in serverless functions

   - Already had correct `binaryTargets = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x"]`

4. **Package.json:**
   - Already had proper `vercel-build` script with `prisma generate`

1. **Enhanced Webpack Configuration:** Better Prisma client bundling
2. **Fixed Vercel Function Patterns:** Only include actual serverless functions
3. **Added Build Environment Variables:** Disabled Prisma Data Proxy
4. **Forced Fresh Build:** Cleared cache and redeployed
